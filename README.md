# splashscreen
Lightweight Cross-Platform (Windows/Linux/MacOS) Splash Screen

The project requires FLTK-1.3.x to build.
You will also need to customize the source code in order to change the splash screen appearance
and launch your own EXE file (by default it launches qprf.exe, one of my other projects).
Configurable pre-built binaries might become available in the future.
